# SSG

SSG is a proof of concept for a very straightforward static site generator written in Elixir as an [escript](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/main/Mix.Tasks.Escript.Build.html). It takes heavy inspiration from [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). It supports multiple templating languages:

* HTML
* Pug
* Markdown

## Future Features

If this ends up becoming something people want, here's a list of things I would add next

* [HEEx](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers.html#sigil_H/2) and [EEx](https://hexdocs.pm/eex/1.12.3/EEx.html) support to enable building basic navigation for blogs
* Compiled releases with support for easy configuration
* More documentation on how it works
* Short video tutorial on how to build a website with SSG
* Support for more templating engines such as [Liquid](https://hex.pm/packages/liquid), [Mustache](https://hex.pm/packages/mustache), [Haml](https://hex.pm/packages/calliope)

Help is wanted, so feel free to send a pull request adding any of these action items. 

## Installation and usage

### Installing

SSG Requires Elixir >= `1.13`.
You can generate the SSG binary by cloning and compiling the project as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/goncalotomas/ssg
cd ssg
mix do deps.get, escript.build
```

This will generate an `ssg` binary on the project root directory. You can then use ssg as follows:

### Using

```
./ssg
```

By default, SSG will look for files in the current directory to generate content from. The files generated by SSG will be put in the `_site` directory. Just before exiting, SSG prints out a short summary of how many files were written to the output directory:

```
Wrote 25 files in 0.09 seconds (3.4ms each, v0.1.0)
```

### Restricting formats

You can use the `--formats` option to specify a list of file formats to search for. In the following example, SSG will search only for Markdown, HTML and Pug template files:

```
./ssg --formats=md,html,pug
```
